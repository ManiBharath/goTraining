# goTraining
Building REST APIs with go lang

Things I learnt:
Go basic syntaxes
Difference between Arrays and Slices
File execution
Managing dependencies
Use the command 'go get .' to install all dependencies

Questions:
Use of go.mod file?
I'm using 'package main' at the start of my file, is it creating a namespace or fetching packages from a certain location?
